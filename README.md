# Pandas Tutorial â€“ Great Learning

Welcome to the Pandas section of the Greatâ€‘Learningâ€‘tutorials repository! This tutorial is designed to guide you through essential Pandas concepts using an interactive Colab notebook.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This tutorial follows the "10â€¯Minutes to Pandas" educational format but delivers hands-on learning through a Google Colab notebook. You'll gain practical experience with:

- Creating and exploring `DataFrame` and `Series`
- Selecting, filtering, and slicing data
- Aggregation, grouping, and summarization methods
- Data cleaning and reshaping techniques

   :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

2. In Colab:  
   - Run each cell interactively  
   - Modify code to experiment with data  
   - Observe outputs and visualizations in real time

## ðŸ§  Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed (Not required locally if you use Colab)
- Basic familiarity with Jupyter/Colab notebooks
- Basic Python knowledge
